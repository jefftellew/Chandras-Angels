## Project Summary
### One Sentence Summary
The project is a platform for multiple people to choose a place to eat based on preference by voting.
### Project Overview
This platform is designed as a solution in social occasions to allow multiple people to easily select a restaurant to eat at with a vote-based system to reflect the preferences of the group. Users can create "parties," private groups accessible with an invite code. Users within a party will be able to choose nearby restaurants to add to the poll, and "upvote" or "downvote" existing choices to adjust their position in the list. The user that created the party is considered the admin user and will have full control over the list, as well the ability to configure various settings of the party. The admin can specify a backup restaurant that will automatically be used in the event that there aren't any user-chosen restaurants.

The platform will be a mobile app developed in Android Studio. Restaurant selection will be implemented via Yelp.
